# Scientific Calculator

This Python application is a scientific calculator built using Tkinter. It supports various mathematical operations, including basic arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan), square root, exponentiation, and more.

## Features:
- Basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /)
- Trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan) in radians
- Square root and exponentiation (^)
- Clear display (C) and backspace (âŒ«)
- Responsive grid layout

## Requirements:
- **Python 3.x**
- **Tkinter** (included with Python)

Ensure you have Python installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

## Usage

### Running the Script

To run the script, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the script.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the script.
4. Run the following command:

   python3 scientific_calculator.py
   ```

### Example Usage:
1. **Basic Operations**: Enter the numbers and operations, and click "=" to evaluate.
2. **Trigonometric Functions**: Enter the angle in degrees, then click "sin", "cos", or "tan" to get the result.
3. **Square Root**: Click "sqrt" to compute the square root of the displayed number.
4. **Exponentiation**: Use "^" to compute powers.

### Example Output:
```bash

```

## Code Explanation

### Main Script

- **GUI Layout**: The calculator uses a responsive grid layout. Each button is assigned to a grid cell, and the buttons are dynamically created using a loop.
- **Operations**: The calculator supports basic arithmetic, trigonometric functions, square root, and exponentiation. The user input is evaluated dynamically using Python's `eval()` function.
- **Error Handling**: When an invalid operation is performed (e.g., dividing by zero or invalid input), the calculator displays "Error".

### Error Handling
- **Invalid Operations**: If the input is invalid (e.g., dividing by zero or using invalid characters), the calculator displays "Error".
- **Trigonometric Functions**: If the user enters an invalid value for trigonometric functions, the calculator catches the error and displays "Error".
